# Introduction to GAS on Linux

## 1) Introduction

Assembly programming allows us to interact with the **bare metal** of the machine. Using **GAS (GNU Assembler)**, a popular assembler for x86 and x86_64 architectures, we can write low-level code that speaks almost directly to the CPU.

GAS is:  
- The GNU Assembler, typically invoked as `as`, and part of the GNU Binutils suite.  
- Used to assemble assembly language source files into machine code for various architectures.  
- Compatible with the AT&T syntax by default, though it can also support Intel syntax via directives.  
- Often used as the backend assembler by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) to produce object files.  
- Cross-platform and supports cross-compilation for different target architectures.  
- Uses a two-pass assembly process: the first to parse and resolve symbols, the second to generate machine code.  
- Supports macros and conditional assembly using `.macro`, `.if`, `.endif`, etc.  
- Produces relocatable object files (typically `.o`) that can be linked using the GNU linker `ld`.  
- Supports various debugging formats including DWARF and STABS for integration with tools like GDB.  


In this exercise, we will write a minimal GAS program that calls the Linux `exit` syscall to terminate a process with a specific return code. This teaches how system calls work, how arguments are passed via registers, and how the program execution begins at `_start`.

To install GAS on your Linux system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install binutils
```

Verify installation:

```bash
as -v
```

Here is your first complete GAS program:

```as
.section .text
.globl _start

_start:
    mov    $60, %rax       # syscall number for exit (60)
    mov    $42, %rdi       # exit code 42
    syscall                # invoke kernel
```

To assemble and run it:

```bash
$ as -o exit.o exit.s
$ ld -o exit exit.o
$ ./exit
$ echo $?
```

This is a minimal, but powerful example that demonstrates the Linux syscall ABI: parameters go into specific registers (`rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`…), the syscall number goes into `rax`, and the `syscall` instruction triggers the transition into kernel space.

Whenever the `syscall` instruction is encounterd in an assembly-program, the processor changes its behavior. Instead of further running in `ring 3` or _User Mode_ the processor clears its _Instruction Cache_, switches into `ring 0` or _Kernel Mode_ and loads the next instructions from a location called **Model-Specific Register / (Long System Target Address Register** or short: `MSR_LSTAR`.

This is a special address, which is set during the boot process. 
The Kernel than takes care of the instructions that were written into the registers (`rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`…).

## 2) Tasks

1. **Install GAS**: Install `gas` via your package manager by installing `binutils` and verify it works.
2. **Exit with Code 7**: Modify the program above to exit with code 7 instead of 42.
3. **Invalid Syscall**: Replace `mov rax, 60` with an invalid syscall number. Observe the behavior!

## 3) Questions

1. What does the `globl _start` directive do?
2. Why do we use `rax` to specify the syscall?
3. What would happen if you omit the `syscall` instruction?
4. What is the difference between the `ld` and `as` steps?

## 4) Advice

Learning assembly is not about writing large programs — it's about understanding the **machine** beneath your abstractions. Starting with a minimal syscall lets you bypass the C runtime, linker conveniences, and libc entirely. This helps to demystify what's really going on when you run a program.

Don’t be afraid to break things. Inspect binaries, modify instructions, and read system call tables. In the words of Donald Knuth:

> “People who are more than casually interested in computers should have at least some idea of what the underlying hardware is like.”
